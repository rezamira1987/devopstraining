### 1. **Docker preview**

- **using a docker image**
  docker run --interactive --tty --rm ubuntu:22.04 /n
  root@938091c5f519 \n
  after running above docker image, ping not work, to resolve: \n
   - ***install ping:***
     ```markdown
     apt update
     apt install iputils-ping


# exit from above container and using first command (line-1) can cause to remove all things that we installed.

# exit and run again first line command:
root@2b2b7398facd

# --rm
this flag cause to remove container after exitting from that container, if we want to keep the container, we should use --name flag instead.

## reza@ubuntu-std:~/git$ sudo docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE          COMMAND       CREATED          STATUS                     PORTS     NAMES
dc5886d4f9b1   ubuntu:22.04   "/bin/bash"   37 seconds ago   Exited (0) 4 seconds ago             my_ubuntu_container
as you can see above, after removing --rm and adding --name instead, the container will be kept. 

--> docker start my_ubuntu_container
--> docker attach my_ubuntu_container
after above commands, we can go to the docker state that we left before, i mean ping is available on the docker
 




### 4. **Preview and Edit the Markdown:**

- **Visual Studio Code:**
  - Use the built-in Markdown preview by pressing `Ctrl + Shift + V` (or `Cmd + Shift + V` on Mac). You can also open the preview pane by right-clicking the `README.md` file and selecting **Open Preview**.
  
- **Visual Studio:**
  - Visual Studio doesnâ€™t have a built-in Markdown preview, so you may want to use an external tool or online Markdown editor for previewing.

### 5. **Add Visual Enhancements:**

- Use **badges** (like build status, license, etc.) for visual enhancement. You can generate badges from sites like [Shields.io](https://shields.io).
- Add **screenshots or GIFs** to make your README more visually appealing. To do this, you can use the following Markdown syntax:
